# kaggle-titanic
Code for [kaggle titanic problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

Goal is to go through this problem with several models to get a working knowledge of `scikit-learn`.

1. `preprocess.py` handles data encoding and preprocessing ahead of time.
2. `<model_name>` has the actual model training and submission creation
3. `submissions` has the final files as submitted to kaggle
